# CSIS516
## The CSIS Inventory and Maintenance System

### Project Description
The CIMS project/software will have asset inventory and maintenance record keeping functions. Additionally, reporting functionality for those records will be available. Assets and their corresponding information such as serial number, purchase date, EOL date, owner, and more will be able to be tracked. Similarly, assets will have a maintenance history so parts of larger assets (such as servers) can have their replacement cycles tracked. 

### Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide more efficient and effective record keeping for CSIS department assets. This project will streamline department recordkeeping operations and enable more efficient inventory and maintenance activities.

### Project Value 
The value derived from this project is saved time, saved money, and an improved student educational experience through cutting edge technologies. As the department's equipment is inventoried in this system the CSIS department will be able to better track how old equipment is, when it needs to be replaced, and the total costs of the department's equipment. From this, we can derive value to ensure the department's technology assets are maintained on a proper cadence to provide students a superior educational experience with cutting edge technology.
